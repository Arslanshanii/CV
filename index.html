                    This project involved the development of a wireless monitoring system that
                    provides secure access control to a door, allowing only recognized faces to
                    unlock it. The system was implemented using a Raspberry Pi microcomputer
                    and Python programming language as the main development tool.
                    The wireless feature of the system enables it to be easily installed and
                    integrated with existing security infrastructure. This, coupled with the Â§exibility
                    and adaptability of the Raspberry Pi platform, makes it a cost-effective and
                    scalable solution for various security applications.

                This project aimed to improve medication adherence for patients by providing a
                reliable and user-friendly reminder system. To accomplish this, an Arduino
                microcontroller was utilized and integrated into the patient's medicine box. An
                LED light was also incorporated into the system, which would Â§ash at
                predetermined times to alert the patient to take their medication.
                The system was designed with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind, making it
                accessible for patients of all ages and abilities. By providing a clear and visible
                reminder, the system helped to reduce the likelihood of missed doses, which
                can have serious consequences for patients' health.
